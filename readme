# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, with a significantly higher number of non-fraudulent transactions compared to fraudulent ones.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    - The credit card transaction dataset is loaded and explored using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
    - The distribution of classes (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent) is analyzed.
    - The relationship between transaction amount, time, and class is investigated.
    - The distribution of features for both classes is visualized using kernel density plots.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - The 'Time' column is dropped as it's deemed irrelevant for model building.
    - The 'Amount' feature is scaled using StandardScaler.
    - Skewness in features is addressed using PowerTransformer to make the distributions more Gaussian.
3. **Model Building with Imbalanced Data:**
    - Several models are built on the imbalanced dataset, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost.
    - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV with cross-validation.
    - Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
4. **Model Building with Balanced Data:**
    - Class balancing techniques (Random Oversampling, SMOTE, and ADASYN) are applied to address the imbalance.
    - Models are rebuilt on the balanced datasets and evaluated.
5. **Model Selection and Evaluation:**
    - The best performing model and oversampling technique are selected based on evaluation metrics.
    - The final model's performance is assessed on the test dataset.
    - The most important features are identified.
    - The best threshold for classification is determined using the ROC curve.

## Final Evaluation

The final model selected is XGBoost trained on data balanced using SMOTE. The model performance with respect to fraud detection (Class 1) is as follows:

- **Precision:** 0.88
- **Recall:** 0.82
- **F1-score:** 0.85

These metrics indicate a good balance between precision (correctly identifying fraudulent transactions) and recall (identifying most of the fraudulent transactions). This level of performance shows promise for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions effectively, minimizing false positives and negatives.
